# A thing I made 1

![](/data/author1/portfolio/Post1/main.jpg)

Once upon a time in a faraway land called WobblyWoo, there lived a group of purple unicorns with polka-dotted manes. These unicorns had a peculiar habit of dancing the tango every full moon. Legend had it that if they didn't dance, the moon would turn into a giant watermelon.

One day, a brave adventurer named Snorkle decided to visit WobblyWoo and witness this strange phenomenon for himself. He packed his bags with an assortment of tools, including a hula hoop and a jar of pickles, and set off on his journey.

As he traversed through the dense forests and treacherous swamps, he encountered a talking mushroom who warned him of the dangers ahead. "Beware of the rainbow-eating goblins," the mushroom cautioned. "They have a taste for pickles and they will stop at nothing to get their hands on yours."

Snorkle took the mushroom's advice to heart and continued on his journey, keeping a watchful eye for any sign of the goblins. Finally, he reached the outskirts of WobblyWoo, where he was greeted by a group of friendly trolls who offered to guide him to the unicorns' dancing grounds.

As they walked, Snorkle couldn't help but notice the peculiar trees that grew in WobblyWoo. They had faces carved into their trunks and spoke in a language only the trolls could understand.

Upon arriving at the dancing grounds, Snorkle was in for a surprise. The unicorns weren't dancing the tango as he had been led to believe. Instead, they were performing a synchronized swimming routine in a giant pool of grape jelly.

Snorkle was awestruck by the spectacle and decided to join in on the fun. He whipped out his hula hoop and twirled it around his waist while the unicorns cheered him on. Just then, the goblins appeared out of nowhere, their eyes fixed on Snorkle's jar of pickles.

Without hesitation, Snorkle tossed the jar into the pool of grape jelly, causing a sticky explosion that sent the goblins flying into the air. The unicorns and trolls erupted into laughter, grateful for Snorkle's heroic act.

As the night drew to a close, Snorkle bid farewell to his new friends and began his journey back home. He couldn't help but smile at the thought of the amazing adventure he had just experienced in the magical land of WobblyWoo.
